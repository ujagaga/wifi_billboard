# Uart Switch #

This is an Arduino project to add a scrool wheel and buttons to the display. The command is passed via UART at baud 9600.

I am using an 8 bit STM micro controller, but you could use any micro controller with at least 6 pins (2 pins for scrool wheel, 2 pins for two buttons, plus 2 pins for UART)

# Uart Switch #

This is an Arduino project to add a scrool wheel and buttons to the display. The command is passed via UART at baud 9600.

I am using AtTiny85, but you could use any micro controller with at least 4 pins (2 pins for scrool wheel, 1 analog pin for two buttons, plus 1 pin for UART TX)

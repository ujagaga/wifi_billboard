# Uart Switch #

This is an Arduino project to add a scrool wheel and buttons to the display. The command is passed via UART at baud 115200.

I am using AtTiny85, but you could use any micro controller with at least 5 pins available (4 pins for buttons, plus 1 pin for UART TX).
My Digistump board has an LED connected to pin B1 and GND, so that button is connected to Vcc and using external pull down resistor. The rest are connected to GND and using internal pull-up resistors.

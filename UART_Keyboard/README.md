# UART Keyboard #

I need 5 push buttons to be detected using a Python script running on an Orange Pi Zero W2. To reduce the CPU usage for this script, I am using an AtTiny85 as a dedicated Microcontroller which sends the number of the pressed button via UART.
The BAUD rate is 9600. When a button is pressed, UART data will be 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. When the button is released it will be 255.
